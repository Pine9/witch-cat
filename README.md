# The Witch's Cat
A text-based rpg about a cat and a mysterious land...

Notes:
- You need python 3 and colorama in order to run this game.
- This was originally a final project for my Intro to CS class, but I had since expanded upon it.
- The base engine is not mine. It was provided by my professor.
- However, the rest (the code contained within the methods and the text of the game) is my own work.
- Save files are pickle files dropped in the same directory as the game.
